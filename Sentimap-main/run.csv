1,@guiledazen44,WIT is the best at capturing the essence of a manga in the best quality possible. They make some of the best impact animations today without looking messy.
2,@user-ft2rs3rl9c,What a time to be a One Piece fan. My heart rejoices
3,@swaggerofablackteen,"I think this is absolutely great, they can have some top tier animation, great pacing and skip the fillers. This is going to get a lot of new folks in to the anime."
4,@Vicdireaper,If wit studios and oda are involved it’s already set in stone that this is going to be a masterpiece
5,@UnderMysKipAntz,The mere thought of someone recreating this anime with top-notch animation and well-paced storytelling is a dream I never thought could come true.
6,@sipdip_7764,Having someone remake this anime with top tier animation and good pacing is something that I would only dream of.
7,@sergiomelendez285,"There is no way they stop at East Blue. This'll be a huge success, people who have been daunted by the anime's length will be able to jump in for the first time and undoubtedly draw in long time viewers. The audience for this will be huge"
8,@user-ie9rh5ph7j,Man it's just amazing to me how a manga kept going on for 25 years and it just grew and spread far and wide. Never falling just kept reaching newer heights.
9,@noimezzasalma1285,"Cuando vi la noticia no lo podía creer!despues de años esta hermosa obra nos sigue llenando de emoción, esperemos que sea un proyecto hecho con todo el cariño que se merece "
10,@NasTyPrincezzBQ,"I started watching One Piece 9 months ago thinking I’ll tap out in less than one arc.

I’ve reached episode 1079 and so glad I committed. This series and community is so amazing."
11,@XoBabyGURLoXYU,Quality and quantity to bring the anime to justice is insane! To Wit studio and Netflix please don’t let us down!
12,@woid0,getting a live action and a remake before the original ends is crazy. goated show
13,@SPREET5454,One Piece fans are having easily some of the best moments of life right now. What a time it is to be a One Piece fan. Thank you Oda!
14,@user-ll4rs7zf5h,"I love that it is new, i hope to god Megumi Ishitani is a part of it. Her vision is so unique and blends so well with the Manga. I know shes normally not a part of WIT studios but she needs to be there in my opinion. I love her work."
15,@xavierbosch7102,"This is what One Piece deserves, a good animation. I hope they keep the original soundtrack."
16,@moonluna__,"Love how in every generation, One Piece is still loved "
17,@fiendyt3677,This could easily be Netflix's most watched show if it comes with perfection
18,@HawkOfDarkness,its crazy how much one piece has blown up in the general public in this past year alone it was always the most popular manga but was still never talked about
19,@yokun5764,"As someone who watch One Piece since their childhood, I feel sense of sadness but also happiness. 
The old one made me love One Piece, even with the silliness, but the new one probably will reflect One Piece as it peak form, which I could never have had. I can't wait!!"
20,@justallwrong5401,"One Piece; a story so great, the creators wanted to tell it again."
21,@UnderMysKipAntz,"I always hoped we would get something like this, without the bad pacing and week to week production limitations this could really be the best version of One Piece out there"
22,@mmbnmae,"one piece is that one manga i love to recommend with the words ""yes, its long but give it a start. you will be hooked to it"". and when this manga ends, the world will rejoice so better hop on the ship while its still sailing"
23,@SorceressRose,It's gonna be insane to watch the East Blue Saga get an update in quality and animation with a different animation team. I can't wait to spot and see all the differences.
24,@taymahmood8922,This has a real chance to become the best anime Of All Time. Everyone i know that has not yet watched one piece because of the length will now get a reason to do so.
25,@otaku_babaa,If WIT studio is re-animating it I'm gonna get into Onepiece finally
26,@danig342,I became a One Piece fan at just the right time. This franchise just keeps on giving!
27,@prodbyomen4581,"Oh God, it's over a thousand episodes and I am still getting excited to watch this for the third time all over"
28,@fufu-annedd,"They better take time and make it worth it for all of us, since it is the greatest anime of all time, Make our eyes glow with God tier animation lesss gooooo."
29,@pabloesco2007,"I begin to watch the Manga at 1997 then the anime in 1999. I'm so ready to see this remake with no filler even if they changed some event, the core of OP gonna be there with brandnew animation. Can't wait."
30,@pressfinchat,"I hope they return to the storybook, fairytale style of the original OP. I remember watching Blackbeard monologuing about people’s dreams in front of Luffy and that was one of the most mesmerizing scenes of OP for me, not only because of what he said but because the visuals really spoke to me."
31,@zoro_Lost__,"I used to dream about it that someone will reanimate one piece ,but i didn't think it was possible. Now its coming true   I'm very happy and looking forward to it "
32,@OMGWTFOMGs,I LOVE what Netflix is doing with One Piece. I am going to be a very happy Netflix subscriber for many years to come.
33,@garretthodsdon3542,I can't believe they are finally making one piece into an anime. How nice of netflix to give light to this small niche manga
34,@woid0,"One Piece Manga, One Piece, One Piece Live Action, (Monsters) and now The One Piece. We were born in the right century after all"
35,@ender2iny,"Isso parece incrível, se não for respeitoso e fiel com a obra original eu desisto"
36,@TaraNasTyPrincezzVR,"Feeling the same as other people, this is literally something I would only dream of"
37,@edgar6497,"as a OnePiece fan i myself feel too connected because im 25yrs old i feel like i grew with the show/manga; like minded fam would be like “damn “ mostly speechless , wanting other people see this joy i had when i first watched it"
38,@chriall,"I loved the style of the old animation over the newer current animation, Hopefully they capture some of the charm that the old one had"
39,@ZagiNoa,"Finally, a good pacing One Piece anime. The greatest manga in the world deserves this much respect for its adaptation."
40,@cauabonetto1161,CARALHOOOOO!!! ARREPIEI TOTAL!!
41,@cuadralboot9653,Lo estaré esperando con ansias el remake de ONE PIECE
42,@geebossman3429,"This is a good idea for new anime watchers to start watching One Piece. Because it currently has over 1000 episodes, new anime watchers find it hard to start the series. But with this new remake, it would make it easy for them and it’s easily available on Netflix. This is Awesome "
43,@NerdGohan,"Wit studio is by far the best studio ive ever seen. After seeing their work in attack on titan and countless other anime, i do believe this remake is in good hands."
44,@hunterking4228,Never will there be another author like Oda Eiichiro.
45,@FRiSkYChIca,"Keys to this being worth the effort:

1. Stay true to the source material.
2. No fillers."
46,@user-wf7zk5uh9v,happy 25th anniversary my favourite anime ever i hope that it becomes the best one yet you will always be one of the best anime ever congrats on the work never give up happy 25th anniversary
47,@markbright662,"PLEASE DO NOT CHANGE THE ONE PIECE ANIME SOUNDTRACK - it is by far and away the best anime soundtrack ever, you can scrap the OSTs but keep the romantic era music"
48,@flusel4949,"I‘m really excited for this, but I hope they keep the original voice actors where it‘s possible."
49,@MIOrko,I really hope it will be a seasonal anime with good animation and pacing.
50,@digchiz8174,"Not in 10 years did i think i would see a full on new modern adaptation of one piece with the first adaptation still going on. I always imagined toei would do something similar to one piece like they did for dragon ball z where they made dbz kai which cut out the fillers and composed to be more faithful and fluid. But a whole new anime is blowing my mind right now, and by wit studio which were phenomenal with attack on titans first 3 seasons. Really looking forward to this and everything else coming in the future"
51,@kuldeep_vasava,You just don't want the fans to die peacefully knowing that we finished one piece.
52,@revelare_xvii6269,The fact that One Piece now has 3 ongoing adaptations happening simultaneously.
53,@chefvin8285,Quality and quantity to bring the anime to justice is insane! To Wit studio and Netflix please don’t let us down! 
54,@rlphy64,"That's how you know it's coming to an end soon. Please don't end soon, One Piece"
55,@gurpreetbajwa4490,I actually think this might be a good thing because if they're going to remake especially the earlier stuff I'd be down for that. It'd be cool to see all that stuff again except done with modern art and technique
56,@robinkremer2447,Proud to be a One Piece fan
57,@XoBabyGURLoXYU,I wanted to watch it again for the first time thanks WIT studio and NETFLIX wish you all the best
58,@manuelk1853,"I'm so happy right now!
I was so overwhelmed by the 1000+ episodes that One Piece has and had to stop watching because it was just too much for me. So seeing it getting remaked with just the important story lines is do great. Looking forward to it, being really hyped"
59,@LoUDMoAninGaLAI,lo mejor que me pasó este año ver one piece
